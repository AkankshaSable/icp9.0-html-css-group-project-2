 <p class="herbal-paragraph">
    <span class="herbal-heading"> Herbal's</span> plants are plants that have adapted to living in aquatic environments (saltwater or freshwater).
     They are also referred to as hydrophytes or macrophytes to distinguish them from algae and other microphytes.
      A macrophyte is a plant that grows in or near water and is either emergent, submergent, or floating. In lakes and rivers, 
      macrophytes provide cover for fish, substrate for aquatic invertebrates, produce oxygen, and act as food for some fish and 
      wildlife.Aquatic plants require special adaptations for living submerged in water, or at the water's surface.
       The most common adaptation is the presence of lightweight internal packing cells, aerenchyma, but floating leaves
        and finely dissected leaves are also common.
