  <span class="fruit-heading"> Indoor's</span>Plants that require a low amount of light and water to thrive are typically known as indoor plants. 
  Ambius considers these plants as examples of common indoor plants: Dracaena. Hedera Helix.
  Outdoor in-ground plants require the soil to be loosened, organic matter added, and once planted, the area should be mulched to keep in moisture. 
  Potted plants or indoor plants do not typically take regular soil but need potting soil to be sure their soil is sterile 
  and nutrient-dense enough for their small homes.
  Beyond aesthetic advantages, indoor plants have many more benefits. They stimulate oxygen generation, enhance indoor humidity levels, 
  and purify the air by absorbing toxins. They can boost focus, creativity, and general well-being, according to several studies
  Through photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, while through transpiration and evapotranspiration, 
  plants release moisture vapor and increase humidity. 
  The NASA Clean Air Study showed houseplants and their associated microorganisms can remove volatile organic compounds from indoor air.
  Indoor-grown plants are cultivated in a more controlled environment than their outdoor cousins. 
  Some of the main appearance-related features of indoor buds are: Brighter Coloration. Tighter Packed Buds. Smaller Buds.
